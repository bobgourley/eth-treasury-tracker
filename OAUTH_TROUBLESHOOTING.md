# OAuth Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
- **Admin Bypass System**: ✅ Working (temporary solution)
- **Google OAuth**: ❌ Not creating sessions (under investigation)

## Issue Summary
Google OAuth authentication completes successfully but fails to create an active admin session. Users are redirected back to the login page after attempting to sign in.

## Debugging Steps Completed

### 1. Environment Variables ✅
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Verified present
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Verified present  
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Verified present
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Verified present
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Set to production URL

### 2. Google Cloud Console Configuration ✅
- OAuth 2.0 Client ID created
- Redirect URI: `https://ethereumlist.com/api/auth/callback/google`
- OAuth consent screen configured
- API credentials match environment variables

### 3. NextAuth Configuration ✅
- Debug mode enabled (`debug: true`)
- Explicit OAuth scope: `"openid email profile"`
- Secure cookie configuration for production
- Admin email allowlist implemented
- Enhanced callback logging

### 4. Code Fixes Applied ✅
- Fixed sign-in callback to return `false` instead of redirect on unauthorized access
- Added comprehensive logging in all auth callbacks
- Fixed async cookie handling for Next.js 15
- Added bypass session checking in admin pages

## Current OAuth Flow Analysis

The OAuth flow appears to complete these steps:
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" ✅
2. Redirected to Google OAuth consent screen ✅
3. User grants permissions ✅
4. Google redirects back to callback URL ✅
5. **Session creation fails** ❌ (root issue)

## Debug Endpoints Available

### `/api/admin/debug`
Shows environment variables, session status, and authorization checks.

### `/api/admin/test-bypass` 
Shows bypass cookie status and environment configuration.

### `/api/admin/bypass-check`
Validates bypass session authentication.

## Temporary Solution: Admin Bypass System

### Access Method
1. Visit: `https://ethereumlist.com/admin/bypass`
2. Enter admin email and secret: `temp-admin-bypass-2025`
3. Redirects to admin dashboard with 24-hour session

### Implementation
- Cookie-based authentication (`admin-bypass` cookie)
- 24-hour session expiration
- Secure cookie settings for production
- Integrated with existing admin page authentication checks

## Next Steps for OAuth Resolution

### Potential Root Causes to Investigate
1. **NextAuth Session Storage**: Database vs JWT token issues
2. **Cookie Domain/Path**: Production cookie settings
3. **HTTPS/Security Headers**: Production environment differences
4. **Google OAuth Scopes**: Insufficient permissions for profile data
5. **NextAuth Version Compatibility**: Next.js 15 compatibility issues

### Recommended Actions
1. Monitor production logs during OAuth attempts
2. Test OAuth flow in development environment
3. Compare working OAuth implementations
4. Consider alternative OAuth providers for testing
5. Review NextAuth documentation for Next.js 15 changes

## Monitoring and Cleanup

### Current Logging
- All OAuth callbacks log detailed information
- Admin page authentication checks logged
- Bypass system usage tracked

### Future Cleanup
- Remove bypass system once OAuth is fixed
- Remove debug logging in production
- Update documentation with final OAuth solution

## Security Notes
- Bypass system uses secure, httpOnly cookies
- 24-hour session expiration for bypass access
- Admin email allowlist enforced in all authentication methods
- Production environment variables properly secured
